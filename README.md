**Problem Statement**   
The objective of this project is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product. This project involves loading the data into data frame, cleaning the data, extracting statistics from the dataset, exploratory analysis and visualizations, and asking & answering questions.  
  
The aim of this project is to find out which are the most relevant features that students consider to choose the preferred American university. Some of the essential questions for developing this project are related to the number of applications, admissions, and enrollments, cost of tuition and fees, cost of living on campus, types of degrees offered, and features of the states where universities are located (population and GDP).

# Step 3: Preparing an Outline & Deadlines - Planning

Outline for a Data Analysis Project   

1. Perform data preparation & cleaning
    - Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas
    - Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.
    - Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data
    - Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, additional columns, merging datasets etc.)
    
2. Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
    - Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns
    - Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.
    - Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.
    - Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis
    
3. Ask & answer questions about the data
    - Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset
    - Answer the questions either by computing the results using analysis or graphs
    - Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation
    
4. Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
    - Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis
    - Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections
    - Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets
    - Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis
